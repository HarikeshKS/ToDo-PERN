# ToDo-PERN

Welcome to ToDo-PERN, a robust To-Do application built on the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React(not yet), Node.js). This repository serves as a practical example of a modern web application, offering seamless task management through CRUD operations and taking advantage of the stack's scalability.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks with ease.
- Utilizes the power of PostgreSQL for a reliable and relational database.
- Express.js provides a robust server-side framework.
- Node.js ensures efficient server-side JavaScript execution.

## Project Structure

The codebase emphasizes clear separation between front-end and back-end components, promoting modularity and maintainability. Dive into well-documented code to understand and extend functionalities according to your requirements.

## Learning Journey

This repository not only provides a solid foundation for PERN stack development but also represents my personal learning journey. Feel free to explore, contribute, report issues, or customize the project to align with your specific needs.
